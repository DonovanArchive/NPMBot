# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a basic bug that isn't economy-breaking, or a big security vulnerability, you can use the `f!bugreport` command to remove it.
If the bug is one that should NOT be reported publicly, ex a permission check error, infinite economy things, etc. Report it directly to a developer, on Discord. (join our [support server](https://discord.gg/ZB6kF3S), and ask to talk to a developer.)
